            </center><br>
            After successfully putting the Mars Orbiter Mission (also known as Mangalyaan) into the orbit of Mars, ISRO declared its plan to launch another mission to Mars. This announcement was made during the Engineers Conclave conference that took place in Bengaluru on 28th October 2014.
 
            Mangalyaan-2 is a space mission of India, which is the second time they are exploring other planets. The mission is planned by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Initially, they were considering including a lander, but later they decided to only send an orbiter. The orbiter will use a special technique called aerobraking to adjust its orbit and get closer to the planet for better observation.<br><br>
            
            The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has a plan to launch a mission by 2024. This mission  will have some advanced cameras and a radar to study the surface of Mars. They will learn more about the early crust, the recent volcanic rocks, and even the boulder falls on the planet. After this mission, they also plan to launch another one in 2030, where they will try to land 
            softly on the surface of Mars.<br><br>

            he mission could capture the full disc image of Mars because of its elliptical orbit; it also generated an atlas of Mars with the help of the colour camera onboard the mission. The mission also captured the time-variation of the Martian polar ice caps; it also measured the Martian apparent albedo that indicated the reflecting power of the Martian surface. The mission also gave an opportunity to classify extra-terrestrial landslides using machine learning models<br><br>

            It was also discussed that despite being designed for a life-span of six months as a technology demonstrator, the Mars Orbiter Mission has lived for about eight years in the Martian orbit with a gamut of significant scientific results on Mars as well as on the Solar corona, before losing communication with the ground station, as a result of a long eclipse in April 2022. During the national meet, ISRO deliberated that the propellant must have been exhausted, and therefore, the desired attitude pointing could not be achieved for sustained power generation. It was declared that the spacecraft is non-recoverable, and attained its end-of-life. The mission will be ever-regarded as a remarkable technological and scientific feat in the history of planetary exploration.
