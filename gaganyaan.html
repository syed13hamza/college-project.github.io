                <h2>GAGANYAAN</h2>
            </center><br>
            Gaganyaan is a special spacecraft that India is making for people to travel in space. It's part of a bigger program called the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. The spacecraft is made to carry three people, and a newer version will be able to meet up and attach to other things in space. In the first trip, three people will go into space in a capsule that weighs 5.3 metric tonnes. The capsule will go around the Earth for up to seven days, and the crew will control most of it themselves. The first trip was supposed to happen in December 2021, but now it won't happen before 2025.

            The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) made a special part of the spacecraft that people can ride in. They tested it for the first time on December 18th, 2014, but nobody was inside. By May 2019, they finished designing it. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is helping with some important things like food for the people in the spacecraft, taking care of their health, protecting them from radiation, making sure they land safely, and keeping them safe from fire.

            <h3>Launch:</h3>
            In June 2020, it was said that the first Gaganyaan launch without people would be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, but the launches with people would still happen on time. The head of ISRO said in June 2022 that they will not launch people until 2024 because of safety worries.<br><br>

            <h3>Crew Module:</h3>
            The Gaganyaan crew module is a spacecraft that can fly by itself and weighs 5.3 metric tons (about 12,000 pounds). It is built to carry three people into space and then come back to Earth safely after being in space for up to seven days. The crew module has two parachutes in case one doesn't work, but it only needs one parachute to land safely in the water. The parachutes help slow down the crew module from a very high speed to a safe speed when it splashes down in the water.

            <h3>Cost:</h3>
           The mission to Mars cost around ₹450 Crore (US$73 million), which is the least expensive mission to Mars ever. The mission was cheap because of some reasons, such as the modular approach, fewer ground tests, and long working hours for scientists. ISRO Chairman K. Radhakrishnan said that these factors helped make the mission inexpensive.
